# LEGACY SPT RELEASES 
- TARGET: 3.9.8
- Live Build: 36217
- Last Updated: 04/11/2025

Legacy releases for people who wish to player older versions of SPT. This is not officially supported or endorsed by the SPT team. This does *NOT* bypass anti-piracy measures. This is simply a way for you to install legacy versions of SPT, current version target is `3.9.8`. I will not provide ways to install any other version of SPT or provide ways to bypass piracy measures. 

If you would like to [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/dirtbikercj) for my time, it would be appreciated.

Please join the [discord](https://discord.gg/XXeSBuKnHP) for discussions around old versions of SPT. Please keep any and all discussions here rather than the official SPT discord out of respect of the wishes of SPT staff/developers who made this project possible in the first place. 

# Why trust this?

This is a safe means of installation, I am a well known [mod developer](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/user-file-list/37201-dirtbikercj/) in the SPT community. I also develop the SPT assembly tool, and I'm listed as an official SPT developer. Always do your due dilligence in researching what/who you download from on the internet. 

# Code of Conduct
- You are *NOT* to ask for support in the SPT discord while running this version of SPT.
  - Doing so can result in you losing your ability to particape in support channels.
- You are *NOT* to bother mod authors with issues with now outdated versions of their mods.
  - Even if it has not been updated to the current version of SPT.
- You are expected to be fully self sufficient and able to handle install directions provided below with no additional help provided. There will be none so don't ask.
- You are expected to find the versions of the mod for the version we are downgrading to here (3.9.8) as of 02/02/2025
- You are on your own when sourcing mods. Some mods are developed purely for new versions and thus only exist for newer versions.
  - Do not bother mod authors about backporting mods in these cases.

# Prerequisites
- Make sure you own a copy of Escape From Tarkov (Edition does not matter)
  - Piracy will *NOT* be tolerated. If found that people are using this for malicious purposes I will no longer provide this service. 
- Make sure your live EFT is fully up to date and the play button is visible.
- Make sure you have played atleast 1 live or PVE raid and that everything works as expected.

# Installation

Due to recent events, this is now access controlled via the discord above. If you were an ass in SPT support when asking about previous versions, you were cross banned and are out of luck.

# Credits

- Battlestate games for developing Escape From Tarkov
- The SPT development team for the modding framework.
