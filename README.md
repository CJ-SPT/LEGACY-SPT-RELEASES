# LEGACY SPT RELEASES 
- TARGET: 3.9.8
- Last Updated: 02/07/2025

Legacy releases for people who wish to player older versions of SPT. This is not officially supported or endorsed by the SPT team. This does *NOT* bypass anti-piracy measures. This is simply a way for you to install legacy versions of SPT, current version target is `3.9.8`. I will not provide ways to install any other version of SPT or provide ways to bypass piracy measures. 

If you would like to [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/dirtbikercj) for my time, it would be appreciated.

Please join the [discord](https://discord.gg/XXeSBuKnHP) for discussions around old versions of SPT. Please keep any and all discussions here rather than the official SPT discord out of respect of the wishes of SPT staff/developers who made this project possible in the first place. 

# Why trust this?

This is a safe means of installation, I am a well known [mod developer](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/user-file-list/37201-dirtbikercj/) in the SPT community. I also develop the SPT assembly tool, and I'm listed as an official SPT developer. Always do your due dilligence in researching what/who you download from on the internet. 

# Code of Conduct
- You are *NOT* to ask for support in the SPT discord while running this version of SPT.
  - Doing so can result in you losing your ability to particape in support channels.
- You are *NOT* to bother mod authors with issues with now outdated versions of their mods.
  - Even if it has not been updated to the current version of SPT.
- You are expected to be fully self sufficient and able to handle install directions provided below with no additional help provided. There will be none so don't ask.
- You are expected to find the versions of the mod for the version we are downgrading to here (3.9.8) as of 02/02/2025
- You are on your own when sourcing mods. Some mods are developed purely for new versions and thus only exist for newer versions.
  - Do not bother mod authors about backporting mods in these cases.

# Prerequisites
- Make sure you own a copy of Escape From Tarkov (Edition does not matter)
  - Piracy will *NOT* be tolerated. If found that people are using this for malicious purposes I will no longer provide this service. 
- Make sure your live EFT is fully up to date and the play button is visible.
- Make sure you have played atleast 1 live or PVE raid and that everything works as expected.

# Installation

These installation directions will assume the install path is `C:\SPT\3.9.8` use whatever path you want.

IMPORTANT: Make sure you are using 7zip for all extractions.

- Copy your live installation to a new folder EX: `C:\SPT\3.9.8`
- Download the patcher from [here](https://pub-31e61bcf69804893b5f957a580307798.r2.dev/uploads/16.1.34861_to_14.9.30626.7z).
  - I did not set up a domain for this, it may get rate limited depending on how many people have installed it that day. if the download fails you need to try again the next day, I will provide no work around for this as this is not something I plan on sinking money into.
- Extract it to `C:\SPT\3.9.8\` and run it.
- Once complete delete the `patcher.exe`
- Now download the SPT files from [here](https://github.com/CJ-SPT/LEGACY-SPT-RELEASES/releases/download/3.9.8/SPT-3.9.8-30626-a0c79ac.7z)
- Extract the spt release into `C:\SPT\3.9.8\`.
- launch `SPT.Server.exe` and wait for the green `server is running...` text.
- launch `SPT.Launcher.exe` and create your profile and begin playing.
