# LEGACY SPT RELEASES (3.9.8)
Legacy releases for people who wish to player older versions of SPT. This is not officially supported or endorsed by the SPT team. This does *NOT* bypass anti-piracy measures. This is simply a way for you to install legacy versions of SPT, current version target is `3.9.8`. I will not provide ways to install any other version of SPT or provide ways to bypass piracy measures. 

This provides a means of installation of `SPT 3.9.8` through means that doesn't include piracy, I simply used the SPT build process to build a release for SPT 3.9.8 and created the patcher to get you from `0.15.1.33420` to `0.14.9.30626`. The intermediate patch used will be what SPT uses when there are client updates, this minimizes maintenance for me while allowing this to exist. 

I am under no obligation to have done this and this took considerable time to setup, so if you would like to [buy me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/dirtbikercj) for my time, it would be appreciated. 

# Why trust this?

This is a safe means of installation, I am a well known [mod developer](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/user-file-list/37201-dirtbikercj/) in the SPT community. I also develop the SPT assembly tool, and am listed as an offical SPT developer. Always do your due dilligence in researching what/who you download from on the internet. 

# Code of Conduct
- You are *NOT* to ask for support in the SPT discord while running this version of SPT.
  - Doing so can result in you losing your ability to particape in support channels.
- You are *NOT* to bother mod authors with issues with now outdated versions of their mods.
  - Even if it has not been updated to the current version of SPT.
- You are expected to be fully self sufficient and able to handle install directions provided below with no additional help provided. There will be none so don't ask.
- You are expected to find the versions of the mod for the version we are downgrading to here (3.9.8) as of 02/02/2025
- You are on your own when sourcing mods. Some mods are developed purely for new versions and thus only exist for newer versions.
  - Do not bother mod authors about backporting mods in these cases.

# Prerequisites
- Make sure you own a copy of Escape From Tarkov (Edition does not matter)
  - Piracy will *NOT* be tolerated. If found that people are using this for malicious purposes I will no longer provide this service. 
- Make sure your live EFT is fully up to date and the play button is visible.
- Make sure you have played atleast 1 live or PVE raid and that everything works as expected.
